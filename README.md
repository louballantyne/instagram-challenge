Instagram Challenge
===================
So, I didn't have much time this weekend. However, I did at least get a bit done! Users can sign up, login and post photos. Posts are displayed on the screen.
I did some testing, but not enough. You can't edit or delete posts. Users can't logout. A post is not attributed to a user in the view.
I didn't use strong params appropriately because I couldn't quickly get it to work so I bodged it. A walkthrough of how to fix this would be super helpful!
I did NOT style this at all. It looks horrific.
Images are saved to localstorage, but with more time I'd use a cloud-based storage system.

## Instructions for use:

* clone the repo
* cd birdstagram
* bundle
* db:create, db:migrate
